  <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      Terminal Trivia is a command line trivia game written in C++ as a personal project to strengthen my programming skills.
      It reads a custom formatted game file and runs entirely in the terminal, allowing multiple players or teams to compete in a 
      text based environment. The project began as a way to practice object-oriented programming, file I/O, and modular design outside 
      of coursework.
    </p>

  <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>
      The goal of Terminal Trivia is to deliver an interactive multiplayer trivia game directly in the terminal.
      Players or teams take turns answering questions loaded from a specified game file, with the program tracking and 
      displaying scores throughout the match. The design emphasizes portability, requiring only a C++ compiler and a text-based 
      question file to run. Future plans include a Qt-based GUI to provide a more visual, user-friendly experience.
    </p>

  <h3>Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Runs from the command line using the syntax <code>./trivia &lt;gameFile&gt;</code>.</li>
      <li>Supports multiple players or teams with independent score tracking.</li>
      <li>Parses a structured text file containing questions, multiple-choice answers, and correct responses.</li>
      <li>Handles input validation and scoring for each round.</li>
      <li>Compiles with a standard C++ compiler using the provided Makefile.</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Results</h3>
    <p>
      Terminal Trivia successfully reads and parses game files, presents questions in a clear terminal interface, and maintains accurate player or team scores through an entire session.
      Its modular design separates logic into Question, Team, and Game classes making it easy to expand with new features or question sets.
      I am currently developing a graphical version using the Qt framework to expand the game beyond the terminal.</p>

  <h3>Code</h3>
