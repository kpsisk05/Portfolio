    <h1>Wi-Fi Network Tracking Robot (WiNTR)</h1>
      <img src="../images/wintr.jpg" alt="WiNTR robot image" style="width:100%; max-width:600px;">
      
      <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>WiNTR is an autonomous robot designed to detect and track a Wi-Fi network's origin. 
        During the summer of 2023 prior to my senior year of High School I held an internship position 
        at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in the ASPIRE program under the mentorship of Rob Rosenberry 
        and Tom Dignan. I worked with two other interns to develop WiNTR.</p>
        
      <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>WiNTR was developed to autonomously track Wi-Fi access points by detecting signal strength and 
          navigating toward the source. Beyond its core function, the robot demonstrates how autonomous vehicles 
          can be used to reduce human effort and identify rogue or unauthorized access points, a critical step 
          in securing wireless networks.</p>
      
      <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Runs on rechargeable Li-ion batteries for at least 10 minutes.</li>
          <li>Controlled by an Arduino-compatible microcontroller.</li>
          <li>Uses an ESP module for Wi-Fi communication.</li>
          <li>Supports a command protocol between client, ESP module, and microcontroller.</li>
          <li>Can autonomously navigate and track a Wi-Fi access point.</li>
          <li>Must include a mechanical kill switch.</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>WiNTR successfully demonstrated autonomous navigation by locating the strongest Wi-Fi access points. 
          Its decision-making process resembled the machine learning principle of gradient descent, continuously 
          moving toward areas of stronger signal strength. The robot's rapid sampling of signal data improved 
          accuracy and reduced error, confirming the viability of the design.</p>

      <h3>My Contributions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Designed and modeled all CAD components, including 3D-printed battery housing, servo mount, and ultrasonic sensor bracket.</li>
            <li>Created and laser-cut the top plate to securely mount system components.</li>
            <li>Performed wiring and soldering of electronic components to support system integration.</li>
            <li>Assisted with testing and debugging to improve robot reliability and performance.</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
          <p>WiNTR was created during the 2023 Johns Hopkins APL ASPIRE internship program under the mentorship of Thomas Dignan, 
            Rob Rosenberry, and Evan Bolt. The intern team included Kevin Sisk, Tinu Vanapamula, and Saron Shimels, 
            who collaborated to research, design, and build the system.</p>
