    <h1>Simulator Controlled Robotic Arm Prototype (SCRAP)</h1>
    <img src="../images/scrap.jpg" alt="SCRAP robot image" style="width:100%; max-width:600px;">
      <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>SCRAP is a simulator controlled robotic arm that responds to user input in a computer simulation 
          and moves accordingly using an Arduino-style microcontroller and several servo motors. The models for
          the robot arm are title the "EEZYbotARM" by creator daGHIZmo on Tingiverse. During the school year of 2024-2025, 
          my senior year of High School, I held an internship position at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics 
          Laboratory in the ASPIRE program under the mentorship of Rob Rosenberry and Tom Dignan. During this time I 
          was enrolled in a research program in school that allowed me to produce SCRAP as well as a research paper 
          on the Robotic Design Process and Robotic Simulations.

        <h3>Proceeding Sections</h3>
          <P>As SCRAP was simultaneously completed as a research project, I have a number of sources that I wrote throughout 
            the project. In place of high level descriptions on this page, I have included three sources below. The first is 
            titled "SCRAP" and is the poster with which I presented my project at the JHU APL ASPIRE presentations which will 
            give a brief yet detailed overview of the robot. The second is titled "High Five" and is the produced research paper 
            from my project. Finally, I have included "Primary Research" which explores the code and iteration process of the robot 
            throught the year of research. 
           </P>
