    <p>
      I am currently a Student Athlete at Swarthmore College in my Sophomore year double Majoring in Engineering and Computer Science with a 
      targeted interest in Robotics. Beyond academics, I play varsity lacrosse, valuing teamwork and discipline 
      both on and off the field. I have gained hands-on experience through internships at Johns Hopkins University 
      Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU APL), devoloping two robots in both group and individual settings. 
      I am eager to bring my interdisciplinary expirience and collaborative mindset to challenging engineering and software roles.
      Outside of engineering, I enjoy playing Lacrosse, golfing, woodworking, and cooking.
